Scripting elements :
<%! public String s ="hello"; %>   --- declaration type  ----has java code to declare
<%= s %>                           --- expression type   ----produce result
   <%= new Integer (54) %>         --- gives output integer 54 in browser
   <%= 24*2 %>					   --- gives output as 48  ---- do calculations(minor calc)
   
   
While coding generally dont use println (not preferred) and always use print for printing anything .
The println and print command are going to do the same thing and to break the use out.print("</br>")


To write the block of java code use scripltes :
<%
int x =10;
for (int i=0;i<x;i++){
	out.print("</br>");
	out.print(i);
}
%>

// you can also conditional statements and others statement as well

//
Why declaration elements in  jsp: 

Since the sciptlets element used to declare the variable ,why do we have delaration expression because 
we can only use access modifier like public ,private and protected in the declaration elements and more imporantly
we can define methods only in declaration elements 

<%! String hello(){
return("hello welcome");
}
%>
<%= hello %>





The comment Scipting element :

	In block comment in java like /* */ is used only inside the scriptlet element <% ...%> 
	<!-- out.print("comment");  -->    this will only prevent the printing part and if a method is called it will execute the code (like redirect to an another page.)
	<!-- <% response.sendRedirect("http://google.com"); %>  -->  in this since there is no print ,it willexecute the code
	but to avoid and makeit as a comment use <%-- <% response.sendRedirect("http://google.com"); %>  --%>




To include a file using directive elememt : 
<!--  For adding the static content  -->
<%@ include file="file 1.txt" %> <%-- // using directive method --%>

Using jsp:include
<!--  for adding the dynamic content -->
<jsp:include page ="file 2.txt"></jsp:include>


To import a class into the jsp file use :
<%@ page import ="java.util.Date" %>
<%= new Date()  %>
