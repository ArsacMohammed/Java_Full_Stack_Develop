Scripting elements :
<%! public String s ="hello"; %>   --- declaration type  ----has java code to declare
<%= s %>                           --- expression type   ----produce result
   <%= new Integer (54) %>         --- gives output integer 54 in browser
   <%= 24*2 %>					   --- gives output as 48  ---- do calculations(minor calc)
   
   
While coding generally dont use println (not preferred) and always use print for printing anything .
The println and print command are going to do the same thing and to break the use out.print("</br>")


To write the block of java code use scripltes :
<%
int x =10;
for (int i=0;i<x;i++){
	out.print("</br>");
	out.print(i);
}

// you can also conditional statements and others statement as well
%>
